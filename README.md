# THIS IS OUR TO-DO LIST :)
Project 8. Graph and Semantic Analysis of Movie database 1
Explore the IMDB 5000 Movie database available at https://data.world/data-society/imdb5000-movie-dataset . The excel file can also be accessed at shared Google drive
https://1drv.ms/x/s!AtcJs3OTsMZuiRctyVt3IVt4lSup
The database contains several attributes for each movie, including main actor, second actor, third actor,
director, movie genre, various user ranking attributes, budget, keywords. We shall consider a network where
the nodes correspond to the actor names and the link is established whenever the two actors are played
together in at least one movie
